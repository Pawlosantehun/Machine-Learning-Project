# Machine-Learning-Project
**Project Title:**
Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts stock market prices based on historical data. The goal is to analyze trends and generate accurate future price predictions to support data-driven investment decisions.

**Tools Used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

**Results:**
The model was successfully trained and evaluated using historical stock data. The results showed that the model was able to capture price trends with reasonable accuracy. The prediction performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
